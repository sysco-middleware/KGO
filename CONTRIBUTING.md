# Contributing

Looking to contribute something to this project? **Here's how you can help.**

## Development environment

To setup a develop environment do you need to have `node` and `npm` installed. Optionally can you use `yarn` instead of `npm` as a package manger.

-   `npm i` Install the dependencies
-   `npm run serve` Spin up a development server

## Key branches

-   `master` is the latest, deployed version
-   `develop` is the latest, development version

## Pull requests

-   Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changesâ€“keep them simple and small
-   Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request

## CSS framework

We make use of the CSS framework [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre). When submitting a UI change make sure to use this framework whenever plausible.
